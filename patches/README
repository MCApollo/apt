    Don't build doc

commit 281dbc8e481fbaeaf7310e0800468d4d212711b8

    don't hang if multiple sources use unavailable method
    
    APT clients always noticed if a method isn't supported and nowadays
    generate a message of the form:
            E: The method driver â€¦/foobar could not be found.
            N: Is the package apt-transport-foobar installed?
    
    This only worked if a single source was using such an unavailable method
    through as we were registering the failed config the first round and
    the second would try to send requests to the not started method, which
    wouldn't work and hang instead (+ hiding the error messages as they would
    be shown only at the end of the execution).
